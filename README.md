I started using anaconda navigator for my second year mini project which  belongs to engineering clinics class. And I started learning more about EDA and creating effective models corresponding to data . I started to create ML models. But I always wonder how this is gonna help in real life . All are saying it will predict future . How this model reach end user ?. I got my internship and learned basics of MLOps. And I wondered “Man this is not what you think, this is  huge than what you think “ . I learnt a lot during my internship. And I wanted to do my final year project using machine learning. We took project called “BLOOD DISEASES DETECTION USING ML”. Problem statement: we created this app for people who lives in urban area ,who cannot spend so much money on hospitals . And I started reading blogs and articles about deploying model. I am not a well known person about MLOps because it’s kind of big out of ocean for my project  . I caught up by one blog in towardsdatasscience about Streamlit . And me and my teammates decided to go for it. And we collected real-time dataset near Coimbatore ( collecting dataset was very difficult phase in this project , None of them was willing to share dataset even we had all formal letters )and started doing EDA and build models. And we deployed it in Streamlit. We created interactive user-interface for our app . And our web app is live!
